# Inputs Recheck
Hollow Knight mod that rechecks input states on state changes. Requires [Vasi](https://github.com/fifty-six/HollowKnight.Vasi/tree/master/Vasi).

The mod provides toggles (in Mod Menu) for re-checking the following inputs:
- Jump
- Dash
- Attack
- Cast
- Quick Cast

There is also a toggle to auto-release superdash. When the setting is on, you need to hold the direction you are facing.
